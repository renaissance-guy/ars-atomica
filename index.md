The bombs fell in October of 1995.

As part of the continuing Soviet Civil War, elements of the Sovereign Party seized control of a missile silo near Kostroma. They planned to launch a medium yield nuclear attack at a Soviet base near the Ukrainian border. They were successful but, unfortunately, failed to override the missile's preprogrammed target—Des Moines, Iowa. President Clinton authorized a response before the missile even entered American airspace. Soviet forces, seeing an American attack, responded in kind. And, in 20 minutes, a billion people were killed and vast tracks of habitation were irradiated.

The world was always stranger than modern people believed. Ghosts and spirits. Demons, devils, and powers. The arcane and divine have always existed in subtle ways. But the death—the firey sacrifice—of one billion souls poured so much power into the world that a very unsubtle tsunami of arcane power circled the globe thrice, mixing with and enhancing the nuclear devastation. It transformed the land, places holy and cursed, the creatures of the earth, and the people. And it killed hundreds of millions more.

It's been 25 years since the bombs fell and the world changed. The survivors exist in suspicious enclaves, as nomadic tribes and scavengers, and as bandits and warlords. Some elements of the previous order still exist. Vast stretches of land are blighted by radiation—arcane, atomic, or both. Mutated creatures roam the wilderness, touched by the blight. Mundane and remarkable objects imbued with power lie in wait for fools to find in the ruins of cities and towns.

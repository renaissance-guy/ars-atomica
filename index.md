The bombs fell on October 13th, 1995.

The Soviet Civil War started in the fall of 1991 with the failure of the August Coup. By October of 1995, the Sovereign Party—fighting for withdrawal of Russia from the Soviet Union—seized control of a missile silo near Kostroma. They planned to launch a medium-yield nuclear missile at a Soviet stronghold near the Ukrainian border. The raid succeeded and they launched their newly-acquired toy. Unfortunately, they failed to override the weapon's preprogrammed target—Des Moines, Iowa. The Americans, led by President Clinton, retaliated as the errant attack entered American airspace. Soviet forces detected the American launch attack and responded in kind. 20 minutes later, billions were dead and vast swaths of the earth were irradiated.

The earth, irradiated or otherwise, has always been stranger than modern people believe. Ghosts and spirits. Demons, devils, and powers. The arcane and divine have always existed in subtle and deniable ways. But the death—the firey sacrifice—of billions of souls in such a short time poured so much power into the world that those who survived no longer doubted.

A tsunami of arcane power radiated from where it all started, Des Moines, circling the globe dozens of times and killing hundreds of millions more. The arcane force mixed with and enhanced the nuclear devastation. Together, they transformed the land—places holy and cursed, they transformed the creatures of the earth, and they transformed the people and their artifacts. They tore open the veil between the realm of the living and the dead, the mundane and the arcane, changing the world forever.

It's been 25 years since the bombs fell and the world changed. The survivors exist in suspicious enclaves, as nomadic tribes and scavengers, as bandits and warlords. Dangerous and altered men walk the wastes, prey, and are preyed upon. Isolated pockets of the previous order still exist in protected valleys, bunkers, and strongholds. Vast stretches of land are blighted, poisoned by arcane and atomic. Mutated creatures roam the wilderness seeking survival and their next meal. Artifacts imbued with power lie in wait for the brave, the hardy, or the foolish to find in ruined cities and towns.

You are a walker of the waste, a scavenger of the scrap, using mind, muscle, and magic to thrive where others have merely survived.
